Hey there! My name is Javon Prince and I was born on the 26th of July 2000 in the Commonwealth of Dominica. 
I grew up in Marigot, attending both of my Primary and Secondary level education in schools situated in the area. 
Throughout my years of growing up I have developed a favorite color which is Purple and a favorite lunch which is Paleau. 
During my early teens I found an admiration for science and 
would hopefully want to contribute something meaningful to the scientific community, particularly in the field of Biology. 
I also like computers and the internet. 
When I was younger I got introduced to the sport table tennis by my brother and ever since loved playing it and watching it, 
I also enjoy watching football. 
Something I also admire a lot is music and when I think about my music preference diverse comes to mind as I enjoy listening to 
our local and regional music(Bouyon and Dancehall) and western music (Classical, Hip-Hop, Rap and Rock Music) and 
I hope to be able to play an instrument in the future like the Guitar or Piano!
