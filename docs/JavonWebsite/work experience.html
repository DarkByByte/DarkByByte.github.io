<p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.8;">I grew up in a home that was partially a shop and so I would sell various products.
That would give me the first work experience of being a cashier. When trying to complete my community hours for highschool I was given the
opportunity to reorganize books at the Library to ensure everything were in correct order. This would give me a little experience of what
it's like to be a Librarian I also worked in my Garden to plant different crops, which also makes me a little farmer.
